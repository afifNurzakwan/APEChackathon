          The heritage and culture of indigenous people are the beauty of every
          region. Preserving their culture and heritage should never be
          prioritized last. By giving them a spot in the economy, they will be
          able to flourish and contribute to a much bigger cause. Spreading the
          beauty that these hidden culture would make a very much dynamic and
          ecofriendly solution.
